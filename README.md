# Tetris
3rd semester Assembly Language project (COAL).


**Project Title: Tetris** - COAL Project â€“ Brick Game

**Project Description**:
The Tetris project, developed as part of the COAL (Collaborative Object-Oriented Application Learning) initiative, is a recreation of the classic brick game where players maneuver falling blocks to create complete lines and score points. Groups of two students undertake this project. The game adheres to specific rules and requirements outlined below, divided into two development phases.


**Game Description:**
Bricks of various shapes descend from the top of the screen. Players must strategically rotate and position these bricks as they fall, aiming to create complete horizontal lines across the playing field. When a line is successfully formed, it disappears, and the player earns points. The game ends if the bricks reach the top of the screen or when the time limit of 5 minutes expires.

**Game Rules and Requirements:**

1) Main Screen Complete Display: The game must have a fully functional main screen displaying the game field, upcoming shapes, timer, and live score.

2) Score: Completing one line awards 10 points.

3) Timer: The game runs for a duration of 5 minutes.

4) Upcoming Shape Display: A preview of the next shape to descend is shown on the screen.

5) Shape Movement: Bricks move from top to bottom, allowing players to manipulate their position as they descend.

6) Brick Stacking: Bricks stack at the bottom of the screen upon reaching the base.

7) Keyboard Controls: Players can move shapes horizontally using the keyboard's left and right arrow keys.

8) Score Accumulation: 10 points are added to the total score for every line completed.

Speed Control: The descent speed of shapes should be balanced, neither too slow nor too fast.

End Screen: At the conclusion of the game, the player's final score is displayed with visually appealing graphics.
